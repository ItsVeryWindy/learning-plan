# Lesson 1
When life gives you lemons, you make lemonade. Unfortunately life has given you a text file that needs parsing into a different format.

## Requirements
1. Must be a console application that accepts the file path of the text file
2. List the words present in a text file
3. List the number of instances of each word
4. List whether or not the number of instances is a prime number
5. Should take into account different kinds of white space (tabs, spaces new lines etc.) and punctuation
5. Print it out in a table eg.

```
| words | count | is prime |
|-------|-------|----------|
| hello | 1     | false    |
| world | 3     | true     |
```
